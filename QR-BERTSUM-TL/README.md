BERTSUM_QFAS contains the script to run BERTSUM on Debatepedia Dataset. Most of the codes are collected from the official [BERTSUM Repository](https://github.com/nlpyang/PreSumm). Instructions to run the code can be found in the official [BERTSUM Repository](https://github.com/nlpyang/PreSumm).

Data need to be pre-processed in Pytorch file format to run using the source code given here. Instruction for data pre-processing in Pytorch file format is given here: https://github.com/nlpyang/PreSumm

During evaluation, the minimum number of tokens should be set to 5 and the maximum number of tokens should be set to 25 to reproduce the result in the Debatepedia dataset.
